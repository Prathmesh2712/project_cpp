 Project Description: Tic-Tac-Toe Game in C++

Introduction:
Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic game played on a grid of 3x3 squares. The objective of the game is to get three of your own marks (either X or O) in a row, column, or diagonal. This project involves implementing a Tic-Tac-Toe game in C++ that allows two players to compete against each other.

Project Steps:

1. Board Representation:
   - Create a data structure to represent the Tic-Tac-Toe board. This could be a 2D array or a vector of vectors.
   - Initialize the board with empty spaces to represent unoccupied positions.

2. Player Input:
   - Implement a mechanism for players to input their moves.
   - Prompt each player to enter the row and column numbers where they want to place their mark.
   - Validate the input to ensure it is within the valid range and that the chosen position is not already occupied.

3. Game Logic:
   - Implement the core game logic to determine the outcome of each move and the overall game result.
   - Check for winning conditions after each move to see if a player has achieved three marks in a row, column, or diagonal.
   - Determine if the game ends in a draw when the board is completely filled and no player has won.

4. Turn Management:
   - Alternate between the two players for their turns.
   - Maintain a variable to keep track of the current player and switch it after each valid move.

5. Display the Board:
   - Create a function to display the current state of the Tic-Tac-Toe board after each move.
   - Print the board on the console, showing the positions of X and O marks.

6. Error Handling:
   - Implement error handling mechanisms to handle invalid inputs and prevent program crashes.
   - Provide appropriate error messages to guide the players in entering valid moves.

7. Game Loop:
   - Wrap the game logic and player input steps in a loop to allow for multiple rounds of the game.
   - Prompt the players if they want to play again after a game has ended.
   - Reset the board and variables for a new game if the players choose to continue.

8. GitHub Repository:
   - Create a GitHub repository to host your Tic-Tac-Toe game project.
   - Include all the necessary source code files, such as the main program file and any additional files.
   - Write a README.md file that provides instructions on how to compile and run the game.
   - Add a license file, such as the MIT License, to specify the terms of use for your project.

Conclusion:
By implementing a Tic-Tac-Toe game in C++, you will create a fun and interactive project that demonstrates your understanding of programming concepts such as data structures, loops, conditional statements, and user input handling. This project also offers an opportunity to practice good coding practices, error handling, and version control using GitHub.
